## Step-by-Step Integration of Hugging Face w/ Loom AI

### 1. Token Data Collection & Preprocessing
<ul>
  <li>
    Loom AI collects on-chain data from Solana, including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transaction history
        </li>
        <li>
          Holder distribution
        </li>
        <li>
          Token metadata
        </li>
        <li>
          Contract creation timestamps
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    This raw chain data is converted into structured datasets (CSV/JSON format).
  </li>
</ul>

### 2. Human Classification
<ul>
  <li>
  A group of human reviewers labels SPL tokens as scam or legitimate based on historical fraud patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
  This labeled data is stored for model training.
  </li>
</ul>

### 3. Feature Engineering & Tokenization
<ul>
  <li>
  Loom AI preprocesses the structured dataset:
  <ul>
    <li>
    Removes noise (e.g., insignificant transactions).
    </li>
    <li>
    Converts blockchain transactions into numerical embeddings.
    </li>
    <li>
    Uses Hugging Face’s tokenization methods to transform structured data into input vectors.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

### 4. Model Selection & Fine-Tuning
<ul>
  <li>
  Loom AI leverages Hugging Face’s pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, Roberta).
  </li>
  <li>
  The model is fine-tuned using the labeled Solana dataset.
  </li>
  <li>
  The loss function is optimized using cross-entropy for binary classification (Scam/Legit).
  </li>
</ul>

### 5. Model Validation & Accuracy Testing
<ul>
  <li>
  The model is tested using AUC-ROC, F1 Score, and Precision-Recall curves.
  </li>
  <li>
  If accuracy is low, Loom AI retrains the model with additional classified data.
  </li>
</ul>

### 6. Deployment via Loom AI API
<ul>
  <li>
  Once the model reaches a high accuracy score, it is deployed as a real-time API.
  </li>
  <li>
  Users can query the API with SPL token contract addresses to check if they are scams.
  </li>
</ul>
