## What is Hugging Face?

Hugging Face is an open-source AI platform specializing in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models. It provides pre-trained models, fine-tuning tools, and APIs for tasks like text generation, classification, and more. Hugging Face’s Transformers library is widely used for deep learning applications, making AI more accessible and efficient.

## How does Hugging Face work?

Hugging Face powers Loom AI’s model fine-tuning process by providing pre-trained transformer models and tools for continuous learning. Once a model undergoes human classification, Loom AI integrates Hugging Face’s framework to refine predictions, adjust parameters, and enhance accuracy. This iterative cycle ensures that models adapt to Solana’s evolving blockchain data, improving scam detection, transaction analysis, and other use cases.
