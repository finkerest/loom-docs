## Introduction

Loom AI specializes in an iterative training cycle, ensuring that models continuously improve based on real-world data and feedback.

## How Loom AI Works:

### 1. Model Creation

* Developers define their AI model's goal (e.g., detecting scam SPL tokens).
* Initial training datasets are selected from the Solana blockchain.
* Model parameters and learning configurations are set up.

### 2. Data Classification

* The model is exposed to raw blockchain data.
* Human reviewers classify key data points (e.g., transaction patterns, holder distribution, bundle checks).
* Classification results provide labeled training data for improved accuracy.

### 3. Fine-Tuning & Learning

* Loom AI integrates with Hugging Face for AI model fine-tuning.
* The model retrains using classified data, refining its accuracy.
* Developers can review logs, adjust parameters, and re-run training as needed.

### 4. Accuracy Validation

* Trained models undergo rigorous testing against real-world scenarios.
* Users validate predictions and provide additional feedback.
* Models are retrained multiple times to reach optimal confidence levels.

### 5. Standardized Scoring System

* Each model is assigned an industry-standard accuracy score.
* Developers use these scores to determine readiness for production.
* For more information, check out our <a href="/documentation/scoring">Model Scoring System</a> section.

### 6. Deployment & Integration

* Once validated, models can be deployed via API or SDK.
* Developers integrate AI models into their Solana applications for real-time use.
* Continuous monitoring ensures models adapt to evolving blockchain trends.

Loom AI follows this cycle iteratively, refining models with each step until they reach high precision and reliability.
