## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Data Collection from Solana Blockchain
<ul>
    <li>
      Sources of Data:
        <ul>
          <li>
            DEX Transactions (e.g., Raydium, Orca, Jupiter)
          </li>
          <li>
            Liquidity Pool Movements
          </li>
          <li>
            On-chain Buy/Sell Orders
          </li>
          <li>
            Wallet Holdings & Large Transactions
          </li>
          <li>
            Staking & Yield Farming Patterns
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Loom AI aggregates this data into a structured format (CSV/JSON).
    </li>
  </ul>
### 2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
<ul>
  <li>
    Price Changes Over Time (Moving Averages, MACD, RSI)
  </li>
  <li>
    Liquidity Inflows/Outflows (How much liquidity is added/removed)
  </li>
  <li>
    Large Whale Transactions (High-volume trades & wallet movements)
  </li>
  <li>
    Holder Distribution Trends (Are new wallets accumulating tokens?)
  </li>
  <li>
    Token Pair Correlation (Does this token move in sync with others?)
  </li>
</ul>
### 3. Human Classification & Market Context Analysis
<ul>
    <li>
      Human reviewers label market events (e.g., “bullish,” “bearish,” “neutral” trends).
    </li>
    <li>
      Classification data helps the AI model learn to recognize similar trends in the future.
    </li>
  </ul>
### 4. Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face Models
<ul>
    <li>
      Loom AI leverages Hugging Face transformer models to train the AI for market prediction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Model types include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Time-Series Transformers (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformers)
          </li>
          <li>
            Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (For wallet relationship mapping)
          </li>
          <li>
            LSTM/RNN Models (For trend forecasting based on past data)
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The model learns from labeled DeFi trends and refines its predictions.
    </li>
  </ul>
### 5. Model Validation & Accuracy Scoring
<ul>
    <li>
      AI predictions are compared against actual market movements to measure accuracy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Metrics used for validation:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
          </li>
          <li>
            Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
          </li>
          <li>
            F1 Score for Classification Tasks
          </li>
          <li>
            AUC-ROC for Trend Classification
          </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If the accuracy is below the threshold, the model is retrained.
    </li>
  </ul>
### 6. Deployment & API Integration
<ul>
    <li>
      The trained model is deployed as an API, allowing developers to query predictions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Example API call for predicting a token's trend:
      ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.trainloom.com/v1/defi_trends"
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        -d '{"token": "SOL", "timeframe": "7d"}'
      ```
      Eg. Request

      ```bash
        {
          "token": "SOL",
          "predicted_trend": "bullish",
          "confidence": 92.4
        }
      ```
      Eg. Response
    </li>
    <li>
      If the accuracy is below the threshold, the model is retrained.
    </li>
  </ul>
### 7. Continuous Learning & Market Adaptation
<ul>
  <li>
  As new blockchain data arrives, the model updates itself with:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Latest market conditions
        </li>
        <li>
          New classified trend data
        </li>
        <li>
          Evolving trading patterns
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Loom AI ensures that predictions stay relevant and accurate.
  </li>
</ul>
