## Introduction

Loom AI specializes in an iterative training cycle, ensuring that models continuously improve based on real-world data and feedback.

### How Loom AI Works:

<ol>
  <li>
    Model Creation
    <ul>
      <li>
        Developers define their AI model's goal (e.g., detecting scam SPL tokens).
      </li>
      <li>
        Initial training datasets are selected from the Solana blockchain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Model parameters and learning configurations are set up.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Data Classification
    <ul>
      <li>
        The model is exposed to raw blockchain data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Human reviewers classify key data points (e.g., transaction patterns, holder distribution, bundle checks).
      </li>
      <li>
        Classification results provide labeled training data for improved accuracy.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fine-Tuning & Learning
    <ul>
      <li>
        Loom AI integrates with Hugging Face for AI model fine-tuning.
      </li>
      <li>
        The model retrains using classified data, refining its accuracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers can review logs, adjust parameters, and re-run training as needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Accuracy Validation
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trained models undergo rigorous testing against real-world scenarios.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users validate predictions and provide additional feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        Models are retrained multiple times to reach optimal confidence levels.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Standardized Scoring System
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each model is assigned an industry-standard accuracy score.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers use these scores to determine readiness for production.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Deployment & Integration
    <ul>
      <li>
        Once validated, models can be deployed via API or SDK.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers integrate AI models into their Solana applications for real-time use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continuous monitoring ensures models adapt to evolving blockchain trends.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Loom AI follows this cycle iteratively, refining models with each step until they reach high precision and reliability.


## Standardized Scoring System
Loom AI assigns models an industry-standard accuracy score based on multiple evaluation metrics:

<ul>
  <li>
    Accuracy: Measures overall correct predictions.

    $$Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$

    <i>Used to assess general model reliability.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    Precision (Positive Predictive Value): Measures the percentage of correctly identified positive cases.

    $$Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$

    <i>Measures the percentage of correctly identified positive cases.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    Recall (Sensitivity): Evaluates how well the model detects actual positive cases.

    $$Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$

    <i>Evaluates how well the model detects actual positive cases.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    F1 Score: Balances precision and recall for scam identification.

    $$F1 = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$

    <i>Balances precision and recall for better fraud detection.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): Provides a balanced measure even for imbalanced datasets.

    $$MCC = \frac{(TP \times TN) - (FP \times FN)}{\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}$$

    <i>Provides a balanced measure, even for imbalanced datasets.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic): Measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.

    $$AUC = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} TPR(f) \, dFPR(f)$$

    <i>Measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.</i>
  </li>
</ul>

Every Loom AI model receives a standardized score based on the above metrics.


## API structure

The Marketing API generally follows REST conventions, with some deviations.

* Resources are typically nouns like subscribers or campaigns.
* Subresources can be multiply nested under resources.
* Actions are usually represented by HTTP methods.
* Responses use the generic JSON content type.

We use the API Specification to describe each endpoint. The API self-description also contains type information to help you error-check your requests.

The root url for the API is `https://dc.api.docs.com/3.0/`. The dc part of the URL corresponds to the data center for your account. For example, if the data center for your account is us6, all API endpoints for your account are available relative to `https://us6.api.docs.com/3.0/`.

There are a few ways to find your data center. It's the first part of the URL you see in the API keys section of your account; if the URL is `https://us6.docs.com/account/api/`, then the data center subdomain is us6. It's also appended to your API key in the form key-dc; if your API key is 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcde-us6, then the data center subdomain is us6. And finally, if you're connecting via OAuth 2, you can find the data center associated with the token via the OAuth Metadata endpoint; for more information, see the OAuth guide.

<Banner type="important">Note: You will see the dc placeholder or an actual data center subdomain in examples throughout this documentation. Either way, make sure to replace it in your code with the data center subdomain for your account, or your request may generate an error.</Banner>

## Connecting to the API

You can authenticate requests using either your API key or an OAuth access token, depending on your use case. You should use an API key if you're writing code that tightly couples your application data to your Docs account data; if you ever need to access someone else's Docs account data, you should use OAuth 2.

For more information on the Docs OAuth 2 flow, see Access Data on Behalf of Other Users with OAuth 2.

If you're integrating with the Docs API using one of the [official client libraries](#0), you won't need to worry about the implementation details for authentication.

### Authenticate with an API key or OAuth 2 token

API keys and OAuth 2 tokens can be used to make authenticated requests the same way. We'll refer to both as tokens.

You can either use HTTP Basic Authentication or Bearer Authentication.

```bash
HTTP Basic Authentication:

  curl --request GET \
  
  --url 'https://dc.api.docs.com/3.0/' \
  
  --user 'anystring:TOKEN
```

## API limits

To improve the experience for all our users, we impose some limits on API requests. These limits prevent a single user from making too many expensive calls at once. Exceeding the limits can result in your API access being disabled, so be cognizant of the quantity and complexity of your requests. Currently there are no options to raise the limit on a per-customer basis.

### Throttling

The Marketing API has a limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You'll receive a 429 error if you reach the limit. At exceptionally high volumes, you may receive an HTTP 429 or 403 without a JSON body.

We recommend that you cache frequently accessed values that do not change often in your application's data store. This will prevent your application from bumping up against the throttling limitations and will likely provide faster access to that data.

### Stream timeouts

The Marketing API has a 120-second timeout on API calls. You may see this type of timeout after you've made a network socket connection and are already sending and receiving data.

Response times are dependent on the complexity of your request and the general load across Docs. Some endpoints in the Marketing API return values that are large and slow to calculate. Once you know what data you need, use the [pagination and partial response](#0) capabilities to request only what is essential to you.
